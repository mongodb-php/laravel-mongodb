This package adds functionalities to the Eloquent model and Query builder for MongoDB, using the original Laravel API.
*This library extends the original Laravel classes, so it uses exactly the same methods.*

This package was renamed to `mongodb/laravel-mongodb` because of a transfer of ownership to MongoDB, Inc.
It is compatible with Laravel 10.x. For older versions of Laravel, please refer to the
[old versions](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/tree/3.9#laravel-version-compatibility).
