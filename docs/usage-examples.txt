Overview
--------

Usage examples show runnable code examples to demonstrate frequently used MongoDB
operations. Each usage example includes the following components:

- Explanation of the MongoDB operation
- Example controller code that runs the MongoDB operation
- Example view code that renders the result
- Output displayed by the view

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

To learn how to set up your application and run the usage examples, see the following
sections:

- :ref:`before-start`
- :ref:`add-usage-examples`

.. _before-start:

Before You Get Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The usage examples are designed to run operations on a MongoDB deployment that contains
the MongoDB Atlas sample datasets. When you run the example code without this sample data,
the output might not match. 

You can run the usage examples from the Laravel web application and MongoDB Atlas cluster that
you set up in the :ref:`laravel-quick-start` guide. After completing the Quick Start, ensure
that your application meets the following requirements:

- Configuration to use an Atlas cluster that contains the sample datasets.
- ``Movie`` model configured to use the MongoDB database
- ``Movie`` view that lists the results
- HTTP and API controller endpoints for displaying and storing ``Movie`` data

.. tip::

   See the :ref:`laravel-quick-start-create-deployment` step of the Quick Start for instructions on
   configuring an Atlas Cluster, and see the :ref:`laravel-quick-start-connect-to-mongodb` step for
   instructions on connecting to the cluster.

   See the :ref:`laravel-quick-start-view-data` step of the Quick Start for instructions on creating
   the model, view, and controller endpoints.

.. _add-usage-examples:

Add the Examples to Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Usage Example page features controller code that you can copy and paste into your Laravel application.

You can add Usage Example sample code to the ``MovieController.php`` file, located in the ``app/Http/Controllers``
directory. Each Usage Example page specifies the following information:

- The ``MovieController.php`` method into which you can paste the code
- How to run the operation and view the expected output
