Overview
--------

Usage examples show runnable code examples to demonstrate frequently used MongoDB
operations. Each usage example includes the following components:

- Explanation of the MongoDB operation
- Example controller code that runs the MongoDB operation
- Example view code that renders the result
- Output displayed by the view

How to Run the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

You can run the usage examples from the Laravel web application and MongoDB Atlas cluster that you
set up in the :ref:`laravel-quick-start`` guide. After completing the Quick Start, ensure that your
application meets the following requirements:

- Connects to the ``movies`` collection in the Atlas sample datasets
- Contains the ``MovieController.php`` and ``browse_movies.blade.php`` files

Then, follow this tutorial to add the usage example code to your Laravel application and view 
the expected results.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Add the Controller Code to Your Application
      
      Copy the example code from the :guilabel:`Controller File Code` tab on the usage example
      page and paste it into the ``MovieController.php`` file.

   .. step:: Add the View Code to Your Application
      
      Copy the example code from the :guilabel:`View File Code` tab on the usage example page and
      paste it into the ``browse_movies.blade.php`` file.

   .. step:: Run the Usage Example Code

      To run the example controller code and view the results, follow the instructions on the
      usage example page.

After completing these steps, you can see the output described in the **Expected Output** section
of the corresponding usage example.
