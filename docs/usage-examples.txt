Overview
--------

Usage examples show runnable code examples to demonstrate frequently used MongoDB
operations. Each usage example includes the following components:

- Explanation of the MongoDB operation
- Example code that you can run from an application controller
- Output displayed by the print statement

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

To learn how to add a usage example to your Laravel application and view the expected output,
see the following sections:

- :ref:`before-start`
- :ref:`run-usage-examples`

.. _before-start:

Before You Get Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the usage examples from your own Laravel application or from the
``{+quickstart-app-name+}`` application created in the :ref:`laravel-quick-start` guide.

The usage examples are designed to run operations on a MongoDB deployment that contains
the MongoDB Atlas sample datasets. Before running the usage examples, ensure that you load
the sample data into the MongoDB cluster to which your application connects. Otherwise, the
operation output might not match the text included in the ``{+code-output-label+}`` tab of
the usage example page.

Unless otherwise mentioned, usage examples use the ``Movie.php`` model class
created in the Quick Start to demonstrate operations on the ``movies`` MongoDB
collection.

.. tip::

   For instructions on loading the sample data into a MongoDB cluster, see
   :atlas:`Load Sample Data </sample-data>` in the Atlas documentation.

.. _run-usage-examples:

Run the Usage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each usage example page includes sample code that demonstrates a MongoDB operation and prints
a result. To run the operation, you can copy the sample code to a controller endpoint in your
Laravel application.

To view the expected output of the operation, you can add a web route to your application that
calls the controller function and returns the result to a web interface.
