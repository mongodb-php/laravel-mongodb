Overview
--------

Usage examples show runnable code examples to demonstrate frequently used MongoDB
operations. Each usage example includes the following components:

- Explanation of the MongoDB operation
- Example controller code that runs the MongoDB operation
- Example view code that renders the result
- Output displayed by the view

How to Run the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

The usage examples are designed to run operations on a MongoDB deployment that contains
the MongoDB Atlas sample datasets. When you run the example code without this sample data,
the output might not match. 

Before You Begin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the usage examples from the Laravel web application and MongoDB Atlas cluster that you
set up in the :ref:`laravel-quick-start` guide. After completing the Quick Start, ensure that your
application meets the following requirements:

- Configuration to use an Atlas cluster that contains the sample datasets
- ``Movie`` model configured to use the MongoDB database
- ``Movie`` view that lists the results
- HTTP and API controller endpoints for displaying and storing ``Movie`` data

Run the Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Usage Example page features example code in the :guilabel:`Controller File Code` and
:guilabel:`View File Code` tabs that you can copy and paste into your Laravel application.

Unless otherwise specified, you can add Usage Example sample code to your application by performing
the following actions:

- Add the code from the :guilabel:`Controller File Code` tab to your ``MovieController.php`` file in the
  ``app/Http/Controllers`` directory
- Add the code from the :guilabel:`View File Code` to your ``browse_movies.blade.php`` file in the
  ``resources/views`` directory.

Follow the instructions on the Usage Example page to run the code and view the expected output.
