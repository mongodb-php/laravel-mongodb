Overview
--------

Usage examples show runnable code examples to demonstrate frequently used MongoDB
operations. Each usage example includes the following:

- Description of the MongoDB operation
- Code example that runs the MongoDB operation, which you can paste into your controller file
- Code example that specifies a view, which you can paste into your view file
- Output returned by the view

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

The usage examples are designed to run operations on a MongoDB deployment that contains
the Atlas sample datasets. When you run the example code without the sample data, the output
might not match. 

Follow this tutorial to set up your MongoDB deployment with the sample data and run the
example code in your development environment. Before performing the following actions,
ensure that you create an Atlas account and deploy a cluster. For information about setting
up an account and a cluster, see the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide
</getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`.

   .. step:: Create a Laravel Application
      
      Follow the instructions in the :ref:`laravel-quick-start` guide to set up
      a Laravel application.
      
      After completing the Quick Start, ensure that your application meets the following
      requirements:
      
      - Connects to the ``movies`` collection in the Atlas sample datasets
      - Contains the ``MovieController.php`` and ``browse_movies.blade.php`` files

   .. step:: Add the Usage Example Code to Your Application

      Copy the example code from the :guilabel:`Controller File Code` tab on the usage example
      page and paste it into the ``MovieController.php`` file.
      
      Then, copy the example code from the :guilabel:`View File Code` tab and paste it into the
      ``browse_movies.blade.php`` file.

   .. step:: Run the Usage Example Code

      Run the following command to start your Laravel application and run the MongoDB operation:

      .. code-block:: bash

         php artisan serve

After completing these steps, you can see the output described in the **Expected Output** section
of the corresponding usage example.
