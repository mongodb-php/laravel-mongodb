You can delete multiple documents in a collection by calling the ``delete()`` method on an
object collection or a query builder.

To delete multiple documents, pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method. Then, delete the
matching documents by calling the ``delete()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Deletes documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a query filter
- Prints the number of deleted documents

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``year`` field is less than or
  equal to ``1910``.
- ``delete()``: deletes the matched documents. This method returns the number
  of documents that the method successfully deletes.
