      You can retrieve multiple documents from a collection

      the ``get()`` method to retrieve the results.

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method to retrieve documents that meet a
set of criteria. When you call the ``get()`` method, MongoDB returns the
matching documents according to their :term:`natural order` in the database or
according to the sort order that you can specify by using the ``orderBy()``
method.

To learn more about query builder methods, see the :ref:`laravel-query-builder`
guide.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Retrieves and prints documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a query filter

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``runtime`` field is greater than ``900``
- ``orderBy()``: sorts matched documents by their ascending ``_id`` values
- ``get()``: retrieves the query results as a Laravel collection object
