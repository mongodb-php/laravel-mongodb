=======================
Find Multiple Documents
=======================

You can retrieve multiple documents from a collection by calling the ``where()`` method
on an Eloquent model or a query builder.

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method to retrieve documents that meet a
set of criteria. MongoDB returns the matching documents according to their
:term:`natural order` in the database or according to the sort order that you can specify
by using the ``orderBy()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Retrieves documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a query filter

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``runtime`` field is greater than ``800``
- ``orderBy()``: sorts matched documents by their ascending ``_id`` values
- ``get()``: retrieves the query results
