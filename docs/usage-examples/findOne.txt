.. _laravel-find-one-usage:

===============
Find a Document
===============

You can retrieve a single document from a collection by chaining the ``where()`` and
``first()`` methods on an Eloquent model or a query builder.

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method and then call the ``first()`` method to
return one document in the collection that matches the filter. If multiple documents match
the query filter, ``first()`` returns the first matching document according to the documents'
:term:`natural order` in the database or according to the sort order that you can specify
by using the ``orderBy()`` method.

To learn more about retrieving documents, see the :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-retrieve` guide.

Example
-------

This usage example retrieves a document that matches a query filter from the ``movies``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. The example uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model
to represent the ``movies`` collection.

This example performs the following actions:

- Defines a query filter that matches documents in which the value of the ``directors`` field
  includes ``'Rob Reiner'``
- Retrieves the first document that matches the query filter, according to the sort order
  specified by the ``orderBy()`` method

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: php
      
      $movie = Movie::where('directors', 'Rob Reiner')
         ->orderBy('_id')
         ->first();

      return view('browse_movies', [
         'movie' => $movie
      ]);

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Title: This Is Spinal Tap
      Year: 1984

      Director: Rob Reiner
      Plot: Spinal Tap, one of England's loudest bands, is chronicled by film director
      Marty DeBergi on what proves to be a fateful tour.

To perform the find operation, add the code from the :github:`browse_movie.blade.php
<mongodb-university/laravel-quickstart/blob/main/my-app/resources/views/browse_movie.blade.php>` view file
to your Laravel application. Then, start your application by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   php artisan serve

Open the following URL in your web browser to view the expected output:

.. code-block:: none

   http://127.0.0.1:8000/browse_movies
