You can update a document in a collection by retrieving a single document and calling
the ``update()`` method on an Eloquent model or a query builder.

Pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method, sort the matching documents, and call the
``first()`` method to match only one document. Then, update this matching document by passing
your intended document changes to the ``update()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database.
- Updates a document from the ``movies`` collection that matches a query filter.

The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:

- ``where()``: matches documents in which the value of the ``title`` field is ``'Carol'``.
- ``orderBy()``: sorts matched documents by their ascending ``_id`` values.
- ``first()``: retrieves only the first matching document.
- ``update()``: updates the value of the ``imdb.rating`` nested field to from ``6.9`` to
  ``7.3``. This method also updates the ``imdb.votes`` nested field from ``493`` to ``142000``.

   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: php

      $movie = Movie::where('title', 'Carol')
          ->orderBy('_id')
          ->first()
          ->update([
              "imdb" => [
                  "rating" => 7.3,
                  "votes" => 142000
               ],
         ]);

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Title: Carol
      Year: 2015
      Runtime: 118
      IMDB Rating: 7.3
      IMDB Votes: 142000
      Plot: Set in 1950s New York, a department-store clerk who dreams of a better life falls
      for an older, married woman.

To view the result, run the operation in a controller endpoint. Then, query for the document that has
a ``title`` value of ``'Carol'`` and pass it to a view to see the updated document.
