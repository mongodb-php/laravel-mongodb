You can insert multiple documents into a collection by calling the ``insert()``
method on an Eloquent model or a query builder.

To insert multiple documents, call the ``insert()`` method and specify the new documents
as an array inside the method call. Each array entry contains a single document's field
values.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Inserts documents into the ``movies`` collection
- Prints the result of the insert operation

The example calls the ``insert()`` method to insert documents that represent movies released
in 2023. This method returns a value of ``1`` if the operation is successful, and it throws
an exception if the operation is unsuccessful.
