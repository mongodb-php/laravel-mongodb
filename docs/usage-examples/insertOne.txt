You can insert a document into a collection by calling the ``create()`` method on
an Eloquent model or query builder.

To insert a document, pass the data you need to insert as a document containing
the fields and values to the ``create()`` method.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies`` collection in the
  ``sample_mflix`` database
- Inserts a document into the ``movies`` collection

The example calls the ``create()`` method to insert a document that contains the following
information:

- ``title`` value of ``"Marriage Story"``
- ``year`` value of ``2019``
- ``runtime`` value of ``136``

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: ../includes/usage-examples/InsertOneTest.php
      :start-after: begin-insert-one
      :end-before: end-insert-one
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {
          "title": "Marriage Story",
          "year": 2019,
          "runtime": 136,
          "updated_at": "...",
          "created_at": "...",
          "_id": "..."
      }
