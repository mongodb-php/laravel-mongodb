.. _laravel-run-command-usage:

=============
Run a Command
=============

You can run a command directly on a database by calling the ``command()``
method on a database connection instance.

To run a command, call the ``command()`` method and specify the database command
document inside the method call. This document includes the command name and
value.

Example
-------

This usage example performs the following actions:

- Creates a database connection instance to access the ``sample_mflix`` database
- Specifies a command to retrieve a list of collections in the ``sample_mflix`` database
- Prints the name of each ``sample_mflix`` collection

The example calls the ``command()`` method to run the ``listCollections`` command. This method
returns a cursor that contains a result document for each collection in the database.
