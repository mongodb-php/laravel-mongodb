Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+odm-short+} to perform **find operations**
on your MongoDB collections. Find operations allow you to retrieve documents based on
criteria that you specify.

This guide shows you how to perform the following tasks:

- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-matching`
- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-all`
- :ref:`Modify Find Operation Behavior <laravel-modify-find>`

Before You Get Started
----------------------

To run the code examples in this guide, complete the :ref:`Quick Start <laravel-quick-start>`
tutorial. This tutorial provides instructions on setting up a MongoDB Atlas instance with
sample data and creating the following files in your Laravel web application:

- ``Movie.php`` file, which contains a ``Movie`` model to represent documents in the ``movies``
  collection
- ``MovieController.php`` file, which contains a ``show()`` function to run database operations
- ``browse_movies.blade.php`` file, which contains HTML code to display the results of database
  operations

The following sections describe how to edit the files in your Laravel application to run 
the find operation code examples and view the expected output.

.. _laravel-retrieve-matching:

Retrieve Documents that Match a Query
-------------------------------------

You can retrieve documents that match a set of criteria by passing a query filter to the ``where()``
method. A query filter specifies field value requirements and instructs the find operation
to only return documents that meet these requirements. To run the query, call the ``where()``
method on an Eloquent model or query builder that represents your collection.

You can use one of the following ``where()`` method calls to build a query:

- ``where('<field name>', <value>)``: builds a query that matches documents in which the
  target field has the exact specified value

- ``where('<field name>', '<comparison operator>', <value>)``: builds a query that matches
  documents in which the target field's value meets the comparison criteria

After building your query with the ``where()`` method, use the ``get()`` method to
retrieve the query results.

To apply multiple sets of criteria to the find operation, you can chain a series
of ``where()`` methods together.

.. tip:: 

   To learn more about other query methods in {+odm-short+}, see the :ref:`laravel-query-builder`
   page.

.. _laravel-retrieve-eloquent:

Use Eloquent Models to Retrieve Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Laravel's Eloquent object-relational mapper (ORM) to create models that represent
MongoDB collections. To retrieve documents from a collection, call the ``where()`` method
on the collection's corresponding Eloquent model.

This example calls two ``where()`` methods on the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to retrieve
documents that meet the following criteria:

- ``year`` field has a value of ``2010``
- ``imdb.rating`` nested field has a value greater than ``8.5``

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Query Syntax
      :tabid: query-syntax

      Use the following syntax to specify the query:

      .. code-block:: php

         $movies = Movie::where('year', 2010)
             ->where('imdb.rating', '>', 8.5)
             ->get();

   .. tab:: Controller Method
      :tabid: controller

      To see the query results in the ``browse_movies`` view, edit the ``show()`` function
      in the ``MovieController.php`` file to resemble the following code:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: php

            class MovieController
            {
                public function show()
                {
                     $movies = Movie::where('year', 2010)
                         ->where('imdb.rating', '>', 8.5)
                         ->get();
                  
                     return view('browse_movies', [
                         'movies' => $movies
                     ]);
                }
            }

         .. output::
            :language: none
            :visible: false

.. _laravel-retrieve-query-builder:

Use Laravel Queries to Retrieve Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Laravel's database query builder to run find operations instead of using Eloquent
models. To run the database query, import the ``DB`` facade into your controller file and use
Laravel's query builder syntax.

This example uses Laravel's query builder to retrieve documents in which the value
of the ``imdb.votes`` nested field is ``350``.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Query Syntax
      :tabid: query-syntax

      Use the following syntax to specify the query:

      .. code-block:: php

         $movies = DB::connection('mongodb')
             ->collection('movies')
             ->where('imdb.votes', 350)
             ->get();

   .. tab:: Controller Method
      :tabid: controller

      To see the query results in the ``browse_movies`` view, edit the ``show()`` function
      in the ``MovieController.php`` file to resemble the following code:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: php

            class MovieController
            {
                public function show()
                {
                     $movies = DB::connection('mongodb')
                         ->collection('movies')
                         ->where('imdb.votes', 350)
                         ->get();

                     return view('browse_movies', [
                         'movies' => $movies
                     ]);
                }
            }

            Plot: Great Migrations takes viewers on the epic journeys animals undertake to
            ensure the survival of their species.

      Then, make the following changes to your Laravel Quick Start application:

      - Import the ``DB`` facade into your ``MovieController.php`` file by adding the
        ``use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB`` use statement 
      - Replace the contents of your ``browse_movies.blade.php`` file with the following code:

        .. code-block:: php

           <!DOCTYPE html>
           <html>
           <head>
              <title>Browse Movies</title>
           </head>
           <body>
           <h2>Movies</h2>

           @forelse ($movies as $movie)
           <p>
              Title: {{ $movie['title'] }}<br>
              Year: {{ $movie['year'] }}<br>
              Runtime: {{ $movie['runtime'] }}<br>
              IMDB Rating: {{ $movie['imdb']['rating'] }}<br>
              IMDB Votes: {{ $movie['imdb']['votes'] }}<br>
              Plot: {{ $movie['plot'] }}<br>
           </p>
           @empty
              <p>No results</p>
           @endforelse

           </body>
           </html>

        .. note::

           Since the Laravel query builder returns data as an array rather than as instances of the Eloquent model class,
           the view accesses the fields by using the array syntax instead of the ``->`` object operator.

.. _laravel-retrieve-all:

Retrieve All Documents in a Collection
--------------------------------------

You can retrieve all documents in a collection by omitting the query filter.
To return the documents, call the ``get()`` method on an Eloquent model that
represents your collection. Alternatively, you can use the ``get()`` method's
alias ``all()`` to perform the same operation.

Use the following syntax to run a find operation that matches all documents:

.. code-block:: php

   $movies = Movie::get();

.. warning::

   The ``movies`` collection in the Atlas sample dataset contains a large amount of data.
   Retrieving and displaying all documents in this collection might cause your web 
   application to time out. 
   
   To avoid this issue, specify a document limit by using the ``take()`` method. For 
   more information about ``take()``, see the :ref:`laravel-modify-find` section of this
   guide.

.. _laravel-modify-find:

Modify Behavior
---------------

You can modify the results of a find operation by chaining additional methods
to ``where()``.

The following sections demonstrate how to modify the behavior of the ``where()``
method:

- :ref:`laravel-skip-limit` uses the ``skip()`` method to set the number of documents
  to skip and the ``take()`` method to set the total number of documents to return
- :ref:`laravel-retrieve-one` uses the ``first()`` method to return the first document
  that matches the query filter

.. _laravel-skip-limit:

Skip and Limit Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example queries for documents in which the ``year`` value is ``1999``.
The operation skips the first ``2`` matching documents and outputs a total of ``3``
documents.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Query Syntax
      :tabid: query-syntax

      Use the following syntax to specify the query:

      .. code-block:: php

         $movies = Movie::where('year', 1999)
             ->skip(2)
             ->take(3)
             ->get();

   .. tab:: Controller Method
      :tabid: controller

      To see the query results in the ``browse_movies`` view, edit the ``show()`` function
      in the ``MovieController.php`` file to resemble the following code:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: php

            class MovieController
            {
                public function show()
                {
                     $movies = Movie::where('year', 1999)
                         ->skip(2)
                         ->take(3)
                         ->get();

                     return view('browse_movies', [
                         'movies' => $movies
                     ]);
                }

.. _laravel-retrieve-one:

Return the First Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve the first document that matches a set of criteria, use the ``where()`` method
followed by the ``first()`` method.

Chain the ``orderBy()`` method to ``first()`` to get consistent results when you query on a unique
value. If you omit the ``orderBy()`` method, MongoDB returns the matching documents according to
the documents' natural order, or as they appear in the collection.

This example queries for documents in which the value of the ``runtime`` field is
``30`` and returns the first matching document according to the value of the ``_id``
field.
