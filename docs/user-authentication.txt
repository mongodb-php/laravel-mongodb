Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate MongoDB users
by using Laravel's native authentication functionality. 

Laravel provides a native ``Auth`` module that includes authentication services,
such as guards that define how users are authenticated and providers that define
how users are retrieved. To learn more about these services, see `Authentication 
<https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/authentication>`__ in the
Laravel documentation.

Modify the User Model
---------------------

By default, Laravel generates the ``User`` Eloquent model in your ``App/Models``
directory. To enable authentication for MongoDB users, your ``User`` model
must extend the ``MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\User`` class. 

To extend this class, navigate to your ``app/Models/User.php`` file and replace the
``use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable`` statement with the following
code:

.. code-block:: php

   use MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

Next, ensure that your ``User`` class extends ``Authenticatable``, as shown in the following
code:

.. code-block:: php

   class User extends Authenticatable
   {
   ...
   }

After configuring your ``User`` model, create a corresponding controller. To learn how to
create a controller, see the :ref:`laravel-auth-controller` section on this page.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code shows a ``User.php`` file that extends the ``MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\User``
class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/auth/AuthUser.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

.. _laravel-auth-controller:

Create the User Controller 
--------------------------

To store functions that manage authentication, create an authentication controller for
your ``User`` model. 

Run the following command from your project root to create a controller:

.. code-block:: php

   php artisan make:controller <filename>

Example
~~~~~~~

The following command creates a controller file called ``AuthController.php``:

.. code-block:: php

   php artisan make:controller AuthController

The ``AuthController.php`` file can store ``login()`` and ``logout()`` functions to
manage user authentication, as shown in the following code: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/auth/AuthController.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:

Enable Password Reminders 
-------------------------

To add support for MongoDB-based password reminders, register the following service
provider in your application:

.. code-block:: php

   MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\PasswordResetServiceProvider::class

This service provider modifies the internal ``DatabaseReminderRepository``
to enable password reminders.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code updates the ``providers.php`` file in the ``bootstrap`` directory
of a Laravel application to register the ``PasswordResetServiceProvider`` provider:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   return [
     App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
     MongoDB\Laravel\MongoDBServiceProvider::class,
     MongoDB\Laravel\Auth\PasswordResetServiceProvider::class
   ];
