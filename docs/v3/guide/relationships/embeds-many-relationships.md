# EmbedsMany Relationship

If you want to embed models, rather than referencing them, you can use the `embedsMany` relation. This relation is similar to the `hasMany` relation but embeds the models inside the parent object.

**REMEMBER**: These relations return Eloquent collections, they don't return query builder objects!

```php
use Jenssegers\Mongodb\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    public function books()
    {
        return $this->embedsMany(Book::class);
    }
}
```

You can access the embedded models through the dynamic property:

```php
$user = User::first();

foreach ($user->books as $book) {
    //
}
```

The inverse relation is auto*magically* available. You don't need to define this reverse relation.

```php
$book = Book::first();

$user = $book->user;
```

Inserting and updating embedded models works similar to the `hasMany` relation:

```php
$book = $user->books()->save(
    new Book(['title' => 'A Game of Thrones'])
);

// or
$book =
    $user->books()
         ->create(['title' => 'A Game of Thrones']);
```

You can update embedded models using their `save` method (available since release 2.0.0):

```php
$book = $user->books()->first();

$book->title = 'A Game of Thrones';
$book->save();
```

You can remove an embedded model by using the `destroy` method on the relation, or the `delete` method on the model (available since release 2.0.0):

```php
$book->delete();

// Similar operation
$user->books()->destroy($book);
```

If you want to add or remove an embedded model, without touching the database, you can use the `associate` and `dissociate` methods.

To eventually write the changes to the database, save the parent object:

```php
$user->books()->associate($book);
$user->save();
```

Like other relations, embedsMany assumes the local key of the relationship based on the model name. You can override the default local key by passing a second argument to the embedsMany method:

```php
use Jenssegers\Mongodb\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    public function books()
    {
        return $this->embedsMany(Book::class, 'local_key');
    }
}
```

Embedded relations will return a Collection of embedded items instead of a query builder. Check out the available operations here: https://laravel.com/docs/master/collections
