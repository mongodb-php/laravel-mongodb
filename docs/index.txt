Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official {+odm-long+}.
This package extends methods in the PHP Laravel API to enable you to configure
your Laravel app to work with MongoDB as a datastore. {+odm-short+} allows you
to use Laravel's Eloquent syntax and Query Builder to work with your MongoDB
data.

.. note::

   This documentation describes the ``mongodb/laravel-mongodb`` package,
   formerly named ``jenssegers/mongodb``. This package is now owned and
   maintained by MongoDB, Inc. and is compatible with Laravel 10.x and
   later.

   To find versions of the package compatible with older versions of Laravel,
   see the `Laravel Version Compatibility <https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/tree/3.9#laravel-version-compatibility>`__
