Schema Builder
==============

This page will show how to use Laravel Schemas to manage indexes and show
examples of each of the following:

- create and drop (is this different from index and dropIndex?)
- collection (what does this method do?)
- determining column existence

It will also provide info on the MongoDB specific operations and
geospatial indexes.
