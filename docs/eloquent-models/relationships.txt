Relationships
-------------

This section describes each of the Laravel Eloquent and MongoDB-specific 
relationships that you can use and provides examples for hasOne, hasMany, 
belongsTo, belongsToMany, embedsOne, and embedsMany.

Each example will show, when applicable,  how to define the relationships, 
access the related models, save/create, destroy/delete, and associate/disassociate.
